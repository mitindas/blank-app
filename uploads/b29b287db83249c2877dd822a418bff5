## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Logo Not Displaying
**Problem**: Image not showing on page
**Solution**: 
1. Verify file exists at `src/assets/logo.jpg`
2. Check import path is correct
3. Check browser console for errors (F12)
4. Try using absolute path `/logo.jpg` if in public folder

### Invoice Data Not Saving
**Problem**: Created invoices disappear after refresh
**Solution**:
1. Check localStorage is enabled in browser settings
2. Open DevTools → Application → LocalStorage to verify data
3. Check browser privacy mode isn't blocking storage

### Form Validation Error
**Problem**: Submit button doesn't work
**Solution**:
1. Ensure all required fields (marked with *) are filled
2. Check that bike model and registration are entered
3. Verify at least one service item is added
4. Check console for specific error messages

### Print Layout Issues
**Problem**: Invoice doesn't print properly
**Solution**:
1. Use Print Preview (Ctrl+P / Cmd+P) to test
2. Check that no CSS is hiding elements
3. Ensure logo dimensions are set correctly
4. Test in Chrome (best print compatibility)

### Mobile Display Issues
**Problem**: Layout broken on phone
**Solution**:
1. Check viewport meta tag is in HTML head
2. Test in mobile browser (not just resized desktop)
3. Clear browser cache
4. Test in different browsers

## 💾 Backup & Migration

### To Backup Data
```javascript
// Export invoices to JSON file
const invoices = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("invoices"));
const dataStr = JSON.stringify(invoices, null, 2);
const blob = new Blob([dataStr], { type: 'application/json' });
// Download blob as file
```

### To Restore Data
```javascript
// Paste JSON into console
const invoices = [/* paste JSON here */];
localStorage.setItem("invoices", JSON.stringify(invoices));
```

### To Migrate to Database
Current system uses localStorage for demonstration. For production:

1. **Replace LocalStorage with API calls**:
   - Change `localStorage.getItem()` to `fetch('/api/invoices')`
   - Change `localStorage.setItem()` to `fetch('/api/invoices', { method: 'POST' })`

2. **Add Backend Server**:
   - Node.js/Express recommended
   - Use MongoDB or PostgreSQL for data
   - Implement authentication

3. **Update API Integration**:
   - Create `axiosInstance.js` or similar
   - Replace all localStorage calls with API calls
   - Add error handling and loading states
